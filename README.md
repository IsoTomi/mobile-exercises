***Course Feedback***

I have nothing bad to say about this course. Material was good and 
everything went well. I really liked this course. 

Vue was something I wasn't so excited about. I would have prefer exercises on 
how to make mobile Angular applications instead. Of course I understand that it 
propably wouldn't fit to this course's timetable or material.

Overall, this was 5 out of 5 for me.

***Self Evaluation***

Last year I had a month long React workshop course so React Native didn't 
cause me any problems. Of course I can't say this about other students. 
If you don't have any knowledge of React, then it could have been difficult 
course to overcome. For me everything was kind of easy stuff. No huge problems.
